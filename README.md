# BookStore Application
Bookstore application was developed by a group of 4 students. The app was a final term project for COE528: Object Oriented Eng Analysis and Design. The GUI-based app was developed using JavaFX for frontend and Java for the backend. I later improvised the app by adding a MySQL database for customers and books information, previously the information was stored in a text file at the end of the session.
